# Docx HTML Converter

Just about every document-writing software alleges its ability to export documents as HTML files. As a formally-trained web programmer who has to actually work with HTML files every now and then, I've found this functionality... lacking.

So, naturally, as a programmer, when my tools proved insufficient, I set about making my own. It turned out to be a great deal easier than I anticipated, thankfully, and barely two hours after I started, I had a finished Python script that read in .docx files and spat out HTML files that kept such formatting as bold text, italics, underlined text... Even headings are preserved.

The program itself is almost laughably simple. A toy, nearly. But a useful toy nonetheless, and one I used to create several pages on my portfolio site- I wrote all of this text in LibreOffice Writer rather than Notepad++ or Atom, and converted it with the tool. Try it out for yourself, if you'd like.
